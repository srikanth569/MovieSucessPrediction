# MovieSucessPrediction

Using social media to predict a Hollywood movieâ€™s box office performance

Overview :

Social media has been demonstrated to be an effective tool for sentiment analysis by multiple research papers. In this project, I will attempt to predict the success or failure of a movie by employing machine learning techniques such as classification using historical data obtained from IMDB and clustering by calculating sentiment index using unsupervised learning techniques. The predictive models will take into consideration many factors including but not limited to: historical performance of the cast; a movie budget; film genre; and, most importantly, comments and remarks about the movie on social media like Twitter and IMDB.
